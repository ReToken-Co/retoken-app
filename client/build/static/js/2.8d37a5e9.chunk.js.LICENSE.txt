/**
 * @class
 *
 * @description Provides an easy-to-use interface to the Ethereum Name Service.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *     var ENS = require('ethereum-ens');
 *     var Web3 = require('web3');
 *
 *     var web3 = new Web3();
 *     var ens = new ENS(web3);
 *
 *     var address = ens.resolver('foo.eth').addr().then(function(addr) { ... });
 *
 * Functions that require communicating with the node return promises, rather than
 * using callbacks. A promise has a `then` function, which takes a callback and will
 * call it when the promise is fulfilled; `then` returns another promise, so you can
 * chain callbacks. For more details, see http://bluebirdjs.com/.
 *
 * Notably, the `resolver` method returns a resolver instance immediately; lookup of
 * the resolver address is done in the background or when you first call an asynchronous
 * method on the resolver.
 *
 * Functions that create transactions also take an optional 'options' argument;
 * this has the same parameters as web3.
 *
 * @author Nick Johnson <nick@ethereum.org>
 * @date 2016
 * @license LGPL
 *
 * @param {object} provider A web3 provider to use to communicate with the blockchain.
 * @param {address} address Optional. The address of the ENS registry. Defaults to the public ENS registry.
